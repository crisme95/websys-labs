        <p>Interview: On teaching at home A scholastic view of life during the pandemic by By John Stotz, Sarah Shiang,
          and Medhini Mankale</p>
        <p>In the last few weeks of the Spring Semester, The Polytechnic met with professors across three schools to
          learn what the transition looked like department to department. What we found, broadly speaking, was that the
          Computer Science and ITWS departments seemed to have transitioned most easily, while studio and lab-type
          courses faced the brunt of the switch to online classes.</p>

        <p>Expert in Ecological Applications of AI Joins Newly Announced Imageomics Institute</p>
        <p>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute computer scientist Chuck Stewart will join a newly created institute aimed
          at using images of living organisms to understand biological processes like species evolution, genetic
          inheritance patterns, and even behavior. Stewart, an expert in the ecological applications of artificial
          intelligence and computer vision, will join the new Imageomics Institute, which is supported by a $15 million
