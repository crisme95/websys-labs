The main technologies that I used in this website is Bootstrap 5, HTML, and CSS. The main
functions of the website were implemented using Bootstrap which has a lot of tools which
made building the website much easier that regular HTML and CSS. It made structuring the
information the way I wanted to with accordions, navbars, columns and rows very simple
and easy to implement. I have all the CSS and images that I used in my assets folder and
have all the individual pages I needed for my site setup in the main directory. Some
challenges I faced when building the website were learning Bootstrap in the time alloted.
I had exams, labs, and other projects that consumed much of the time that I would've used
to continue learning this very powerful tool. A problem I ran into on the faculty page was
that I wanted to implement the popover function from Bootstrap when you clicked on the image
of the faculty member and a popover with their info would show up. The function kept breaking
so I resorted to using a row and column structure.
