For our website, I started by creating the home, events/activites, and tutoring
form pages. I used Boostrap to make the form, the navbar, and stylize the webstite
as well. The navbar starts out under the banner for the page but when you scroll
down far enough it will stick to the top of the page.

I add an off canvas pop up which shows the social media links as well as the contant
info for GNH. For the JSON, I have a button which reveals more general info about
the honor society. I spent a long time trying to figure out why my JavaScript was
not working when I was implementing the jQuery. It turns out that I had my script.js
file referenced before the reference to the jQuery file. This meant that I was not
getting any of the code for my script.js file which is why my code wasnt working.
After realizing that silly mistake, I was able to get my AJAX to work.
