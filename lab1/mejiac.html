    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>My name is Cristian Javier Mejia and I am a Computer Science and Information Technology & Web Science student at
      Rensselear Polytechnic Institute. I grew up in Paramus, NJ but
      my parents are from the Dominican Republic. My father works with computers so I naturally gained an interest in
      them and I'm excited to learn more about them while I'm in school.
      I didn't have any really coding experience when coming to RPI and it was difficult at times but I've made friends
      along the way and we faced the challenge together. I'm currently
      taking some Computer Systems Engineering courses as well to explore the hardware side of computing as well.
