When making my profile page, I took the resume page that I made for Intro to ITWS and updated
some of the information as there are courses that I've completed that I added to my relevant
coursework and some skills that I've gained as well. I also updated how I structured all the
information as the way I had some of the tags setup wasn't to my liking as I've learning more
about how to structure webpages. Some issues I've ran into is some simple errors that were
uncovered when I ran my pages through the HTML validator. My page has basic CSS because I've
been looking at other profile pages and I've been deciding what I should do with my page so
that it appears more professional. As well as learning how to do things better, I've exchanged
ideas with my teammates on how to improve my work as well as theirs. We all learned about the
hCard format which was simpler than we thought to implement and was an easy to display our
personal information.

Our entire group portfolio and personal portfolios are in the group-portfolio directory within 
this folder, everything that we submitted for lab 1.
