    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>My name is Cristian Javier Mejia and I am a Computer Science and Information Technology &amp; Web Science student
      at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute. I grew up in Paramus, NJ but my parents are from the Dominican Republic. My
      father works with computers so I naturally gained an interest in them and I'm excited to learn more about them
      while
      I'm in school. I didn't have any really coding experience when coming to RPI and it was difficult at times but
      I've
      made friends along the way and we faced the challenge together. I'm currently taking some Computer Systems
      Engineering
      courses as well to explore the hardware side of computing as well.
