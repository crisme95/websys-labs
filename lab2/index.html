            <p>
              Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof
              may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of

              be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if
              there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal

              President.
