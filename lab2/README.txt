First, I began researching other annotated Constitution sites and looking at how they had
their information structured. I then began reading what their annotations were for each
part of the Constitution and used that to generate my own descriptions for the Constitution.
After working with my teammates to annotate all the Articles and first 10 amendments of the
Constitution, we began working on developing the structure for the site.

Our document is made up of section tags and having header tags as child elements for proper
HTML markup. We then copied the Constitution into paragraph tags within the sections. For
the annotations, I used the Tooltip widget from the jQuery library which lets the user see
the annotation for that section of the Constitution just by hovering their mouse over it.

At first, we had the tooltip widget only function on the text itself, but our team decided to
work on making it apply to the entire section tag so that the hover function wasn't so
finicky. I also added some Google fonts to replace the default fonts and I think that it
also makes the text easier to read.
