First, I began researching other annotated Constitution sites and looking at how they had
their information structured. I then began reading what their annotations were for each
part of the Constitution and used that to generate my own descriptions for the Constitution.
After working with my teammates to annotate all the Articles and first 10 amendments of the
Constitution, we began working on developing the structure for the site.
